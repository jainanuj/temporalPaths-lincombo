1. The input format for the temporal graph G: (1) the first line consists of two integers, "n" and "M", the first integer "n" is the number of vertices in G, the second integer "M" is the number of edges in G; (2) "M" lines are followed, each line denotes one temporal edge and consisits of four integers in the format "u v t lambda". The "M" lines are sorted in the order of their starting time, that is, in the ascending order of "t"; (3) the vertex IDs are ordered from 0 to n-1.

2. two parameters: argv[1]: option (choose from "earliest latest shortest fastest minhop (new option added by sanaz)"); argv[2]: the input graph. 

Example:
./tempath earliest example.txt

Added by sanaz: 
The third and forth arguments (the forth argument is optinal) are the number of source nodes and the path to the file containing the source nodes. Therefore, the example call will be: 
./tempath earliest example.txt <number of source nodes> <path to the init file>[optinal] 

Where init_file is the file containing the source nodes from which the single source shortest paths are computed.
